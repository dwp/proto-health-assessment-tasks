           Chopping vegtables such as carrots can be hard as my grip on the knife isn't always strong enough to chop all the way through. I use things in the kitchen like an automatic tin opener and a kettle tipper. 
           I somtimes need to ask a family member with chopping large amounts of food or when heavy objects need carrying around the kitchen.

          <p>A timer needs to be used when cooking meals, so that a pan is not forgotten about during cooking to avoid the contents from boiling over or being burnt. </p>
